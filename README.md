## Welcome!

I created this personal README to help you learn more about me and my working style.

## Hej, I'm Thomas
> Nice to meet you :smiley:

+ I come from a small village near Nuremberg, Germany. The region is also called Steigerwald. I grew up on my family farm with three sisters.
+ After my studies I travel a lot and hike across the Alps.
  + My greatest hike: From Munich to Venice in 23 days. Check out [my post](https://www.t-boe.de/traumpfad-muenchen-venedig/)
  + You can find my trips on [my Instagram](https://instagram.com/thomasboe_/).
+ **I feel alive when I am in the mountains.** My biggest dream is to have a tiny house in the Alps. I am very close to nature and loves running. One day I would like to run the World Marathon Majors.
