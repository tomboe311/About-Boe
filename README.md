## Welcome!

I created this personal README to help you learn more about me and my working style.

## Hej, I'm Thomas
> Nice to meet you :smiley:

+ I come from a small village near Nuremberg, Germany. The region is also called Steigerwald. I grew up on my family farm with three sisters.
+ After my studies I travel a lot and hike across the Alps.
  + My greatest hike: 600 km from Munich to Venice in 23 days. Check out [my post](https://www.t-boe.de/traumpfad-muenchen-venedig/)
  + You can find my trips on [my Instagram](https://instagram.com/thomasboe_/).
+ **I feel alive when I am in the mountains.** My biggest dream is to have a tiny house in the Alps. I am very close to nature and loves running. One day I would like to run one of the World Marathon Majors.

## My role
My current job title is: Software Developer PHP. But I would say it's a full stack developer job. I administer our servers. Do DevOps tasks. Design new software. Plan many projects and handle the communication. Also I write backend and frontend code.

In 2018, I started my own business on the side.

## My working style
+ **I'm based in CET and like to start by 6 am.** I'm a early bird. Sometimes I go running before work.
+ **I take a longer break during the day** to go for a walk outside.

## Strengths and quirks
It's really hard for me to talk about my strengths. I'm rather introverted and my parents taught me to be modest.  I think that's also a German habit. For the past four years, I have learned a lot about self-care and self-love. My focus is on my strengths and weaknesses, too. I like to make mistakes, because that's the only way I can learn and grow.

+ **Stepping out of my comfort zone**
+ **I like to plan everything**
+ **Excellent listener** and always have a open ear, be it for professional or private matters.

On my quirky side
+ **German is my native language** and it is difficult for me to speak English because I am shy. Once I know you better, things will go more smoothly.

##### Inspired by

I found [Anne Lasch's](https://gitlab.com/alasch/about-anne) ReadMe. She inspired me because many things match my personality! So I wrote my own ReadMe.
